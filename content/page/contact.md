## ✨Hello!✨

![Coding!](https://media4.giphy.com/media/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/giphy.gif)

I am a Software Developer living in Turkey. In my spare time I like to deal with and support open source projects.

I have always been excited to find simple and fast solutions when faced with problems that do not have clear solutions using up-to-date technologies. That's why I always try to stay in a state of research and learning. My life motto is trial and error. Thus, I can improve my skills by seeing my mistakes, and besides, I learn a lot of information.

Here are some informations about me:
